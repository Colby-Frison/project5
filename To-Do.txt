X is check mark

first half of main file (project5)

[X] create section to read the file
    [X] open file
    [X] read file 
    [X] close file

[X] store words in unordered map
    [X] store words in tokens separated by ' ' 
    [X] store frequencies in map
    [X] find some way to make sure everything is actually being stored including new lines
    [] see if having numbers in the text file causes any errors

[X] Sort unordered map by frequencies
    [X] Choose a method of sorting
        - converts to map then multimap where key and value are switched, needs to do this since map can't be sorted by value
    [X] Sort in decreasing order
        [] Figure out if theres a specific method of sorting for tokens that have the same frequency

second half of main file (project5)

[X] compress the file
    [X] re-open the file
    [X] read file and print index of the token in the map separated by a space

[X] save encoded data to a txt file
    [X] save list of indices to a text file
    [X] The legend also needs to be output somehow to decoder can access it
        - Its just going to another text file, but there may be alternative instructions
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(project5-decompress)

[X] Read encoded text file
    [X] Will probably encounter an error where new lines are not implemented properly

[X] As the txt file is read translate indices into their token
    - its decoding it but not correctly at the moment
    [X] Either output this with cout or save it to a text file as done before
        - output not specified yet, so actual instructions are unclear

[X] Addition checker to simply compare new text file to original one

 - Just started the program and made to-do list. I tired to account for edge cases, but this project is pretty simple os there isn't 
   a whole lot to worry about
 - With that this is probably the simplest project so far. Its literally just reading a file to a  map with words:frequency. I like
   just started and im already almost done. I'll try to finish this in the break later, but we'll see.

 - Finished the compression part of the program already, also made it output to a text file, still need to do the decompression part 
   of the program, but I don't think that should be that difficult. I think the hardest part of that will just be actually putting the
   legend of tokens into the txt file efficiently. 
 - I should be able to finish that by later today, but without the input or output files I don't really know If im doing anything 
   correct.

 - I think compression works, I started decompression, and it print out a statement based on the tokens, but its completely wrong.
 - I'll try to fix it later today if I have time, but at the moment it still needs some work

 - Everything is done, its very likely I'll have to change some stuff based on the desired input and output, but with my test cases
   compression AND decompression both work.
 - This project overall was pretty easy, mainly because we were permitted like 6 libraries, but I ain't complainin'.

 - Everything works properly, I forgot to add to this through the dev process so there is a lot of missing details in the logs and on
   the to-do list but I'm done os its chill. 
 - In the project instructions it says to use the output of the base project as the input for the bonus section, but in gradescope it
   pushes in the base input and expects the same line. This isn't nesssesarily a hard fix, but it just took a few minutes to migrate 
   the og to the bonus and make everything work without any conflicting variables. I also had to get rid of the output from the base
   since it isn't needed in the bonus.
 - Everything works now and a part 2 and 3 isn't needed for the bonus section, so there really isn't much else to do, the only other 
   thing I'm going to do is add some additional comments to the bonus section, so in case it is checked it doesnt look horrible. I'll 
   also go in and make sure all the code and comments for the base project is good before I move on from it.
